# Distribution Enhancement

Based on Manjaro Linux, Synconix is a Linux Audio environment designed for ~~crime~~ live and studio production.

# Networked Audio

Using Ansible, JackTrip, Ray Session Manager, qmidinet and OSC, multiple hosts can be configured for use during a live or recording session.

# Ansible and the learning curve

Ansible is used to store configurations and propagate changes to all nodes within an environment.

# workspace flow

This was project was partially motivated by a desire for workflow expierence that could be replicated. A stable environment to use the computer as an instrument of sound in both a studio and live setting.

i3 is primary used although any DE will work. Using a tiling window manager has a couple of advantages including a low memory/cpu footprint which saves on CPU usage. As part of a workflow, keyboard shortcuts enable for easy switching between what could be several open applications.

Download the Live ISO to get a feel for using i3 in an audio production workflow.
