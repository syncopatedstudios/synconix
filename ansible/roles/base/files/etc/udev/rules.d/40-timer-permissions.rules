# To account for any hardware timers, such as a real-time clock (/dev/rtc) or high-precision event timer (/dev/hpet), there should also be a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ dealing with these devices, and it should contain:
KERNEL=="rtc0", GROUP="audio"
KERNEL=="hpet", GROUP="audio"
# It is safe to have this file even if your hardware contains neither device, so you can include/create it if you are not sure.
