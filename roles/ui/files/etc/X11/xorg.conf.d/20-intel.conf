# If you experience issues with default SNA (e.g. pixelated graphics, corrupt text, etc.), try using UXA instead, which can be done by adding the following line to your configuration file:
Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel Graphics"
  Driver "intel"
  Option "AccelMethod"  "sna"
  Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
